<body>
    <h1 style="color: rgb(235, 121, 121); font-size: 50px;"> With pleasure i can help you to rebook.</h1>
    <h1 style="color: rgb(255, 255, 255); font-size: 30px;"> I wish I could provide you with a better alternative but i'd like to tell you that to amend your reservation, we have to book the car again. It's the only way to have the change accepted by the rental company and the process is completed through a live market system.</h1>
    <h1 style="color: rgb(255, 255, 255); font-size: 30px;"> I will do my best to find a good offer for you with the same price and mabey with the same supplier</h1>
    <h1 style="color: rgb(255, 255, 255); font-size: 30px;">let me just ask you about the age and the country of the main driver</h1>
    <h1 style="color: rgb(74, 134, 34); font-size: 30px;"> Tell the customer all the offer(Car category, Passengers, Mileage, Fuel policy, Transmission, Air condition ecc.)</h1>
    <h1 style="color: rgb(252, 5, 5); font-size: 40px;"><b><i>If the pice is higher than the previous one and the customer is angry</i></b></h1>

<h1 style="color: rgb(255, 255, 255);  font-size: 30px;">I am very sorry that the prices are currently higher than usual, I appreciate that this must be frustrating.</h1>
<h1 style="color: rgb(255, 255, 255);  font-size: 30px;">I just want to tell you we are in a live market and we can not garantee the prices.</h1>
<h1 style="color: rgb(255, 255, 255);  font-size: 30px;"> The rates I quoted are provided directly by the suppliers and as such are unfortunately beyond our control. If you decide to amend, the money you already paid will be used towards the new booking, so you will only be charged the difference.
</h1>
<h1 style="color: rgb(252, 5, 5); font-size: 40px;"><b><i>offer AXA if applicable</i></b></h1>
<h1 style="color: rgb(255, 255, 255); font-size: 30px;">EX: I can see that your excess is within the AXA damage refund insurance coverage,so if you choose to add it, it will cover your excess up to EUR 3000 in cases of damages or theft.</h1>
<h1 style="color: rgb(255, 255, 255); font-size: 30px;">AXA Insurance will refund you in case of being charged by the supplier for damage to the vehicle, although it doesn’t remove the need for the main driver to leave a deposit amount blocked on their credit card when they arrive at the desk. AXA protects the excess up to 3000 EUR and the body of the car (doors, roof, glass, undercarriage, and tires). In case of being charged for damage, you can open a claim through the AXA claims portal, and you will be asked to upload the receipts and damage report which the supplier normally provides these documents at the end of the rental.</h1>
